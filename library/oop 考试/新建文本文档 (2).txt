A1

Daily maximums of seismograph measurements are stored in a sequential input file (positive real numbers).
地震仪的每日最大测量值存储在顺序输入文件中（正实数）。
     According to Richter’s magnitude scale, a measurement is considered an earthquake if it is larger than 3. 
     根据Richter的震级标度，如果测量值大于3，则将其视为地震。
    We can assume that the seismograph has measured several earthquakes already.
     我们可以假设地震仪已经测量了几次地震。

How many days have passed between the first two earthquakes, according to the file?
    文件显示，前两次地震之间相隔了几天？

Lufthansa has published statistical data in a sequential input file: 
        汉莎航空已在顺序输入文件中发布了统计数据：
         date (string), flight number (string), passenger capacity (natural number), number of passengers (natural number).
           The file is ordered by date.
          日期（字符串），航班号（字符串），载客量（自然数），乘客人数（自然数）。
            该文件按日期排序。
