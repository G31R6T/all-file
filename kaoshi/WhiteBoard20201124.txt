2020.11.24
agenda:
- Administration (B2, B3, C1 retake)

  The date of C1 retake: 15th of December from 12:10 to 13:00 (50 minutes)
  - communication with user (input/output)
  - input data checking by specification
  - your code should be matched to algorithm

  The deadline of B3 assignment is 4th of December (10 days!)
  There are 2 parts of B3 assignment
  - First (that you have to upload till 4th of December)
  -- don't have to communicate with users
  -- don't have to check the input data
  -- you have to creaet/use function

  - The second part of B3 (needs till 11th of December)
    Zsuzsa will specify the exact date and the exact task
  -- you have to communicate with users
  -- you have to check the input data
  -- you have to create documentation (D1 assignment)
  

- Short quiz exercises regarding source code - done
- Short quiz exercises regarding algorithm - done
- Complex task processing - specification, algorithm, code

Rain task
- input data 
  N - number of weeks
  We need a 2 dimensions array Nx7
  a) sequence calculation - N times => It can be ane amount at the end
                                       but the specification requires N data
     And we know the task b, and the input of task b require these N data
     The temporary/work output => N numbers (one value per week)
  b) maximum selection

Input: N ϵ ℕ
       X1..Nand1..7 ϵ ℕNX7 (2 dimensions array)
Precondition: 2<=N<=1000
              0<=Ri,j<=1000  (R means probably rain...)

Output: SumRain 1..N ϵ ℕN
        M ϵ ℕ  (number of week when the rain was increasing day by day)
        IncWeek ϵ ℕM

Postcondition a: Sum (it is not so easy...)
