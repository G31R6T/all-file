Name:Li zhipeng   Neptun code:G31R6T   assignment 1: 2 

This is an experiment to simulate plant growth factors:
Requirements:
Simulate the behaviors of the plants, and print out the radiation of the day and the properties 
of the plants on each day.

If a plant runs out of its nutrients, it dies.
and other living.

Each day:
alpha , delta, or no radiation

The reaction:
it changes its nutrient level, and affects the radiation of the next day.

a. 3 <= alpha
b. 3 <=delta
c. no radiation.



Properties of the plants: 
name (string), nutrients (integer), living (boolean).

 The types of the plants : puffs, deltatree, parabush.
( Different plants correspond to different radiations and have different effects ).


A possible file content:
4 (The first line contains the number (n) of the plants.)
Piggy (name)  p(type)  7( initial nutrient level)
Slender  d    5
Dumpy   b   4
Willowy  d   3
10(Days)

The program should ask for the name of the file, 
 and it has to print out the name of the survivors
(we can assume that the file is existing and its format is valid).
